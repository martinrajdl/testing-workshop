				<!-- test is some code that runs, and tells whether or not your application behaves as expected -->

				<section>
					<section><h4>Why should I write tests?</h4></section>
					<!-- When i look back at code ive written 6 months ago I internally scream in terror-->
					<section><h5>Development is a complex process</h5></section>
					<!-- 
					Is is also a process of discovery, answering unknowns, finding out how things work, also
				
					-->
					<section>
						<h5>
							And it's really hard to get things right, on the
							first try
						</h5>
					</section>
					<!-- finding out new possibilities for implmentation and feature
					and product requirements, that change in time -->
					<section>
						<h5>
							You do something, then you do it better, then you do
							it better again
						</h5>
					</section>
					<!-- There are a feew people that benefit from you writing tests -->
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Test automation, fewer bugs, happier users</li>
							<li>
								You make new things faster, happier project
								manager, stakeholder
							</li>
							<li>Documenting code, happier colleagues</li>

							<!-- 
							Very practical usecase, we work at a large company, many people come in and need to work on your code without your input
							also product and code changes constantly, and even further, not every code is well and easily testable, so writing tests, 
							forces us write more granular, understandable and composable code that can be taken apart and tested
							-->

							<!-- you are never done, unless it's the project you started two weeks ago and will never finish -->

							<li>Code refactoring, happier you</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>
							Tests help you iterate, refactor, write better code
						</h5>
					</section>

						<h4>Which ones and how many should I write ?</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Unit tests</h5>
						<!-- Unit is a small piece of code with dedicated and expected functionality that has some ouput -->
						<!-- uni tests are really small, easy to write, and easy to run, you can run them all the time -->
						<!-- they force us write things that are easily testable - small granular code, that can be put into test, without too many direct dependencies -->
						<!-- ENFORCE GOOD PRACTICES -->
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Integration tests</h5>
						<!-- 
						A little bit like bigger unit tests, they test that some things work together as expected, either multiple application layers
						multiple components, multiple functionalities
						they require a little more setup and are a little harder to write, but they also provide more context
						-->
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>End to End (E2E) tests</h5>
						<!-- 
							Require a lot of resources, are really hard to setup and much harder to write, also give the most confidence, that things actually work
							real world test
						 -->

					<section><h4>What are good tests?</h4></section>
					<!-- you can definitely take multiple aspects to what makes tests good, but according to our previous definition on why you should be writing them and how they are beneficial
					you can also thing, at to what degree are they beneficial to these people -->
					<section><h6>Help refactoring</h6></section>
					<!-- tests that ask good questions -->

					<!-- tests that test functionality - end result, output, that things work - not how they work, they don't test implementation, how somehting behaves
						also, if tests test implementation and how something works, instead of what it does, they will break when you refactor, which will slow down your work
					-->

					<!-- example here is that, if you HAVE A machine thats tests an animal to see if it is a dog, 
						and your deciding factor is that it has a tail, teeth and makes noises, 
						and if it doesnt fit these criteria, alarm goes of
						if you are asking a bad questions
						if you give it a dinosaur, and it passes it as a dog, you didn't write a very good test
						

					-->

					<section><h6>Give you confidence</h6></section>

					<!--tests that meaningfull, they test things that matter for the user to work, 
						and they test it to reasonable depth,
						look for edgecases and branches in logic-->

					<!-- tests that give us confidence, that no matter what changes we did, things are not ending up in flames -->

					<section>Coverage?</section>
					<!-- 
							test coverage says how much in % of your code is tested, and it's not a metric you need to live to by
							
						-->
					<!-- TODO drawing -->

						<h4>Test tools</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Launchers</b> - Karma, Jest</li>
							<!-- Test launchers are given a list of tests, and the various configuration and scaffolding necessary 
							to run those tests (what browsers to run in, what babel plugins to use, how to format output, etc). -->

							<li><b>Structure</b> - Mocha, Jest</li>
							<!-- Testing structure refers to the organization of your tests. Nowadays,  -->
							<!-- describe, it, good for documentation -->
							<li>
								<b>Assertion functions</b> - Chai, Jest
								<!-- They provide the function that compare what you expect and what you actually get 
								expect(something).toBe(something similar)
								-->
								<!-- Assertion functions are used to make sure that tested variables contain the expected value. 
								-->
							</li>
							<li><b>Mocks</b> spies and stubs - Sinon, Jest</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Helper libraries / enzyme, react-testing-library
								(working with DOM)
							</li>
							<li>Code coverage</li>
							<li>
								Browser - puppeteer (NEAT), Cypress.io
							</li>
							<li>Visual Regression Tools</li>
							<li>Snapshots</li>
						</ul>
